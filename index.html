I was to look at an image on a earby billboard and determine what Josh Wright wanted for Christmas, based on Santa's list in the image. It seemed to easy to be true. And it was.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body">Oh boy, the S3 Buckets. First thing inside the castle grounds, and quite an intense welcome. From the terminal, I was given a ruby script called "bucketfinder.rb" and a wordlist. To operate them I ran the worlist against the bucketfinder and it revealed three AWS S3 buckets - all of which were private. The buckets I found were entitled "kringlecastle", "wrapper", and "santa". After trying everything I could think of to get in these buckets, remembered there was an S3 talk offered by the creator of this hack-a-thon, so I went there next and learned that if a bucket was in fact available, I would be notified of its openness upon searching it with the bucketfinder. So these three buckets, no good.</div>
                    <div class="modal-body">"What if the bucket I'm looking for isn't in my search?" I thought. I ran cat against the wordlist, to find that the only three words in there were the three folders that wouldn't open for me. I needed to add something here.</div>
                    <div class="modal-body">Remembering that the whole point of this challenge was to fix the "Wrapper3000" I added that to the wordlist. Nothing. Why? Oh yeah, AWS only uses lowercase letters! I switched it to "wrapper3000" and boom, I got a bucket and downloaded its contents!  </div>
                    <image src="images/S3instructions.PNG"></image>
                    <div class="modal-body"> Now the hard part. After looking at the package's contents and running the nonsense inside against some ciphers, I figured out it was in base 64 and I sent that to a new file and unzipped it. The resulting file was titled package.text.Z.xz.xxd.tar.bz2. Wow. That's a lot of wrappers. Each of these extensions had to be researched and unwrapped - with the proper options and sometimes sent to a new file to unzip.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body">I'll be totally transparent and say this took the better part of a day but goodness was it satisfying getting down to the package.txt, which was the answer to submit to complete the challenge. </div>

                    <div class="modal-body">I spent a fair amount of time exploring all over the first floor of the castle after spending so much time in the courtyard. There was a main room, like a grand lobby, complete with a number of elves with suggestions, a Christmas tree, and an exceedingly creepy portrait of Santa! One of the elves in the entrance suggested that if I found any random items on the ground that I should be sure to pick them up. So I scoured the place and found a bolt, a green light bulb, and a red light bulb. Random, but probably would prove helpful.</div>
                    <div class="modal-body">I also learned from an elf in the first floor lobby that there were a) multiple floors in the castle and b) that the Santavator which could get me to said floors was broken. But I jumped into the santavator anyway to see if I could poke around.</div>
                    <div class="modal-body">Inside was just a broken elevator panel, nothing groundbreaking. What <em>was</em> groundbreaking though, was behind the panel. When I opened it up with the provided key I saw three differently-colored sockets and a stream of what looked like mist. To make things more interesting, there was a little legend that indicated the different socket combinations that needed to be powered to get to the different floors.</div> 
                    <image src="images/legend.PNG"></image>
                    <div class="modal-body">What was also exciting behind the panel was the fact that all of the "random" items that I'd found around the castle were just sitting there, and could be moved around to manipulate the stream of mist. So I got to work trying to get the red and green sockets powered with the stream using my items. I eventually got them both powered, redirecting the string using my bolt and a piece of candy cane, and was able to go up to the second floor and the roof! On each of those floors I encountered more elves, more challenges, and more items!</div>

                        a LOCK signal, an UNLOCK signal, and one more LOCK. My goal was to identify through the very dense log which log item was the UNLOCK moment and submit that item to complete the challenge. I was provided with two items in the terminal, candump.log and a script called runtoanswer. While the log was overwhelming at first, I knew I could grep through it and boil down some of the noise in the log. I noticed that the vast majority of the items in the log began with "244xxxxxx" so I filtered them them out using "grep  -v "244*" candump.log </div>

To complete the challenge, you had to get all lollipops in one sitting at the terminal. Requested commands included basic navigation such as "ls, pwd, cd, rm, cat, find" and other commands like grep (with some options and wildcards), changing permissions, and killing processes. This was a pleasant challenge, a bit of a breather from some of the more technical, dense, terminal-style ones.

                        Once I gained access to the Workshop on Floor 1.5, I started poking around and found a proxmark on the floor! At that point I knew I was
                        going to be swiping something from someone. Upon further inspection I noticed that
                        there was a CLI feature attached to the proxmark. This terminal didn't have the nice, handy-dandy instructions that most of the others had, so I got to thinking - what am I supposed to be stealing?

                      <div class="modal-body">
                        It hit me that I had always seen clusters of other players crowded around the elves in the castle, so I went to the nearest one and opened the proxmark. Which did nothing! So I started looking up proxmark commands and found a GitHub proxmark repo. In there I learned about a command "lf hid read" that I thought might be useful since the fifth challenge was entitled HID Lock. Lo and behond I got something.</lf>

                      <div class="modal-body">I scratched down what I got on a piece of paper: a 10 digit number, something fc, and a card number. Initially I wasn't sure what to so with this info, so I tried going up to some of the locked challenges and repeating the same command, which got me absolutely nothing. Next I tried to do the same thing next to some locked doors around the castle. Nothing. Which I realized, honestly, made sense because I wasn't trying to <em>capture</em> something, I was trying to <em>use</em> the creds. So I went back to the proxmark cheat sheet I'd found and sifted through what felt like a million commands until I fell across one that seemed to match up with the info I had gotten "lf hid sim -r ### --fc ### --cn ####".</div>

                      <div class="modal-body">I quickly scooted up to Santa's Workshop to the first locked door that popped into my mind, and ran that code. Boom, I was in. The newly opened room was dark save for a light at the very end, into which I walked, thinking there might be a challenge under there. No challenge, BUT I was teleported through the wall an out of the creepy painting on the first floor. I could't find my character's avatar so I started moving my mouse and discovered the I WAS SANTA!!!</div>
                      <div class="modal-body">It was probably 11:50pm at this point, so I guarantee that my happy dance woke the neighbors!</div>

For every question the player had to find and eliminate munchkins who had stolen all the lollipops and were hiding in the system. To complete the challenge, you had to get all lollipops in one sitting at the terminal. Requested commands included basic navigation such as "ls, pwd, cd, rm, cat, find" and other commands like grep (with some options and wildcards), changing permissions, and killing processes. This was a pleasant challenge, a bit of a breather from some of the more technical, dense, terminal-style ones.

                        I'd had enough of the wall I'd hit with the Santavator. Three out of five floors - not good enough. I jumped back in the elevator and pulled up the DevTools in Chroms and started digging for anything that might get me the missing button for Floor 1.5 or that would get me past the needed thumbprint for Floor 3.

                     <div class="modal-body">Back on the html page I was looking at the Santavator's button elements and RIGHT. THERE. IN. FRONT. OF. MAH. FACE. There it was. An attribute on my working first-floor button called "data-floor". I didn't need to be sifting through anything, I could just change the data-floor number on my working buttons to go wherever I want! And that's exactly what I did and just like that, I had access to all floors.</div>

                        Once I gained access to the Workshop on Floor 1.5, I started poking around and found a proxmark on the floor! At that point I knew I was
                        going to be swiping something from someone. Upon further inspection I noticed that
                        there was a CLI feature attached to the proxmark. This terminal didn't have the nice, handy-dandy instructions that most of the others had, so I got to thinking - what am I supposed to be stealing?
                      </div>
                      <div class="modal-body">
                        It hit me that I had always seen clusters of other players crowded around the elves in the castle, so I went to the nearest one and opened the proxmark. Which did nothing! So I started looking up proxmark commands and found a GitHub proxmark repo. In there I learned about a command "lf hid read" that I thought might be useful since the fifth challenge was entitled HID Lock. Lo and behond I got something.</lf>
                      </div>
                      <div class="modal-body">I scratched down what I got on a piece of paper: a 10 digit number, something fc, and a card number. Initially I wasn't sure what to so with this info, so I tried going up to some of the locked challenges and repeating the same command, which got me absolutely nothing. Next I tried to do the same thing next to some locked doors around the castle. Nothing. Which I realized, honestly, made sense because I wasn't trying to <em>capture</em> something, I was trying to <em>use</em> the creds. So I went back to the proxmark cheat sheet I'd found and sifted through what felt like a million commands until I fell across one that seemed to match up with the info I had gotten "lf hid sim -r ### --fc ### --cn ####".</div>

                      <div class="modal-body">I quickly scooted up to Santa's Workshop to the first locked door that popped into my mind, and ran that code. Boom, I was in. The newly opened room was dark save for a light at the very end, into which I walked, thinking there might be a challenge under there. No challenge, BUT I was teleported through the wall an out of the creepy painting on the first floor. I could't find my character's avatar so I started moving my mouse and discovered the I WAS SANTA!!!</div>
                      <div class="modal-body">It was probably 11:50pm at this point, so I guarantee that my happy dance woke the neighbors!</div>
